# Hex-Bolt-Design-Task1.1-
 hexagonal bolt with helical threads and a washer designed in Onshape




 # Overview
This project features a hexagonal bolt with helical threads and a washer designed in Onshape. 
The bolt is an essential component in mechanical assemblies, providing secure fastening for various engineering and construction applications




# Design Tools Used
1- Revolve – To generate the cylindrical base shape of the bolt
2- Extrude Add and remove – To add the hexagonal head and washer section
3- Sweep – To create the helical threads for proper fastening
4- Fillet – To smooth out sharp edges and improve manufacturability




# Key Features & Applications
-  Strong and Durable: The helical thread design ensures a secure grip and load-bearing capacity.
-  Manufacturable: Can be produced using 3D printing, CNC machining, or traditional lathe operations.
-  Versatile Use: Ideal for mechanical assemblies, structural joints, and automotive components.
